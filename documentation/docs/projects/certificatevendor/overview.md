# CERTIFICATE VENDOR

## Introduction

The certificate vendor manages the rotation of certificates involving a number of moving parts across CDF and AWS IoT.

There are two flows for certificate rotation. In the fist case, device certificates are pre-created and registered before the rotation request. In this case the device requests a new certificate and is vended an S3 presigned URL in order to download the certificate package. In the second case, the device provides the certificate vendor service a CSR. In this way the device can request an updated certificate while keeping the private key on the device. The certificate vendor then uses a CA certificate registered with AWS IoT to create a device certificate from the CSR and return this certificate to the device.

## Pre-Requisites

### Pre-created Certificates

A certificate package comprising of the certificate, public key and private key is to be created and registered with AWS IoT.  This certificate package is to be zipped, and stored in S3 with the name of the zip matching the name of the intended device.  The certificateId is associated with the certificate package by setting the _x-amz-meta-certificateid_ S3 user metadata attribute of the zip file.

### Certificate Creation with a Device CSR

A CA certificate needs to be registered with AWS IoT. In addtion, the CA private key needs to be encrypted and stored in EC2 Parameter store so the certificate vendor service can sign device certificates using the CA.

## Auto-deploy

The following resources are automatically created by the deployment script, and utilized by this flow:

A Thing Group (default named _cdfRotateCertificates_).  Add devices to this group that require certificates rotating.

Using cdf-commands a command template is created to define the structure of an AWS IoT Job to request devices to rotate certificates.  Again using cdf-commands a command is created of the template to create an continuous AWS IoT Job targeting the rotateCertificates Thing Group.  Both the template and command creation is handled by the platform deployment script.

Example cdf-commands template:
```json
{
    "templateId": "RotateCertificates",
    "description": "Rotate certificate of targetted devices",
    "operation" : "RotateCertificates",
    "document": "{\"subscribeTopic\":\"${cdf:parameters:subscribeTopic}\",\"publishTopic\":\"${cdf:parameters:publishTopic}\"}",
    "requiredDocumentParameters": [
        "subscribeTopic",
        "publishTopic"
    ]
}
```

Example cdf-commands command:

* {rotateCertificatesThingGroupArn} and {deviceActivationRuleName} are injected by the deployment script
* {thingName} is replaced on the device side by the device itself

```json
{
 "templateId": "RotateCertificates",
 "targets": ["{rotateCertificatesThingGroupArn}"],
 "type": "CONTINUOUS",
 "rolloutMaximumPerMinute": 120,
 "documentParameters": {
        "subscribeTopic":"cdf/certificates/{thingName}/+",
        "publishTopic":"$aws/rules/{deviceActivationRuleName}/cdf/certificates/{thingName}"
    }
}
```

## Certificate Rotation Flow

As part of the device startup sequence it should subscribe to AWS IoT jobs.  

Add the device to the _cdfRotateCertificates_ Thing Group.  This will send a job to the targetted device which instructs the device to start the certificate rotation process.  The Job document contains the publish and subscribe topics for certificate rotation.  

Example job document (the device to replace the {thingName} token):

```json
{   
    "operation": "RotateCertificates",
    "subscribeTopic":"cdf/certificates/{thingName}/+",
    "publishTopic":"$aws/rules/cdfcertificatevendordevelopmentMQTTRule1OS64259XAGQQ/cdf/certificates/{thingName}"}
}
```

Certificate Vendor supports two methods of requesting certificates:

* pre-created certificates which live in S3 and are returned vi presigned URL when the device does a `get`
* a device does a `get` and supplies a CSR in the request - certificate vendor signs the certificate with an IoT registered CA and returns the certificate to the device via the MQTT response

The device sends a request to the cdf-certificate-vendor via the above publish topic.

Example MQTT message body sent from the device to the AWS IoT Gateway:

```json
{
    "action": "get"
}
```

Example MQTT message body sent from the device including a CSR:

```json
{
    "action": "get",
    "csr":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----\nCSR CONTENT\n-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----"
}
```

Example message sent from AWS IoT Gateway to the cdf-certificatevendor (post message transformation by the AWS IoT Rule):

```json
{
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "certificateId":"b77135fa885e8e48e42671a6335df5662a7da01e03625768ca572efa2bb131ee",
    "action": "get"
}
```

The AWS IoT Rule adds the device ID as well as the certificate ID used in the connection to the message payload sent to the Certificate Vendor Lambda function.

Upon receiving the request, the cdf-certificate-vendor validates that the device has been whitelisted. If whitelisted, Certificate Vendor checks for the presence of a CSR in the request. If provided, Certificate Venor uses the CSR to create a device certificate which it returns to the device. If a CSR is not present, Certificate Vendor proceeds to download the S3 Object Metadata associated with the certificate package to retrieve the certificateId, activates the certificate, then constructs and returns a pre-signed url to the device for downloading of the certificate package.  Final the device status is updated to activated.

Below are example success responses sent from cdf-certificationvendor to the device, published to the cdf/certificates/{thingName}/accepted MQTT topic:

Pre-created certificate to be retrieved from S3:

```json
{
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "action": "get",
    "location": "https://cdf-157731826412-us-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/certificates/device123.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAI7VRYYSEBBSSAXGQ&Expires=1542129538&Signature=fbuiPsYAhzj1TDMn4JjD6cX%2Bs4U%3D"
}
```

Certificate requested by the device with a CSR:

```json
{
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "action": "get",
    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nCERTIFICATE CONTENT\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
}
```

Upon receiving the response, the device downloads the certificate package (if delivered via presigned URL) and replaces its existing certificates, followed by sending an acknowledgement to the cdf-certificate-vendor.  Upon receiving the ackknowledgement the cdf-certificate-vendor the device is removed from the rotateCertificates group.

Example acknowledgement message:

```json
{
    "action": "ack"
}
```

If any failures occur during this flow, a rejected message is sent to the device, publish to the cdf/certificates/{thingName}/rejected MQTT topic.  Example message:

```json
{
    "deviceId": "device123",
    "action": "get",
    "message": "DEVICE_NOT_WHITELISTED"
}
```

## Security

An IoT profile should exist to enforce the device to use its Thing Name as the MQTT clientId.  

In addition the profile should be configured to allow devices to receive AWS IoT Jobs, and to allow for publishing requests to and receiving responses from the cdf-certificate-vendor service as itself.

Only whitelisted devices (devices that registered with the Asset Library) are authorized to request new certificates.
