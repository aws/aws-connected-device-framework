# ASSET LIBRARY CONFIGURATION

## Optional Configuration

The following represents optional configuration that can be provided at time of deployment via the Asset Library's `{env}-config.json` file. If a value is listed, this is the value that is bundled into the application as a default. You only need to specify a configuration value from the following if you need to change it:

```json
{
    /*
      Events may be published to an MQTT topic for any additions, updates
      or deletions to groups, devices, policies, group templates, device 
      templates and/or profiles. The following represents the default 
      topics that are built into the application. To disable, override 
      with an empty string.
    */
    "events": {
        "groups": {
            "topic": "cdf/assetlibrary/events/groups/{objectId}/{event}"
        },
        "devices": {
            "topic": "cdf/assetlibrary/events/devices/{objectId}/{event}"
        },
        "policies": {
            "topic": "cdf/assetlibrary/events/policies/{objectId}/{event}"
        },
        "groupTemplates": {
            "topic": "cdf/assetlibrary/events/groupTemplates/{objectId}/{event}"
        },

        }
    },

    "defaults": {
        /*
          When a device is created, if certain attributes are not provided then
          these defaults are used. These only need to be set if they need to be 
          changed:
        */
        "devices": {
            /*
              If no intial group to be associated with is provided when the device
              is first created, the following `relation` is created to the 
              specified  `groupPath`:                 
            */
            "parent": {
                "relation": "parent",
                "groupPath": "/unprovisioned"
            },
            /*
              If no initial state is provided when the device is first created,
              the state is set to the following:
            */
            "state": "unprovisioned"
        },
        "groups": {
            /*
              Early versions of the Asset Library allowed devices and groups to be
              added to any device/group type as its parent. Later this was changed 
              so that the  allowed parent types may be defined in the device/group 
              template, but to be backwards compatible this feature is disable by 
              default. Set to `true`  to enable.
            */
            "validateAllowedParentPaths": false
        }
    },

    /*
      Optional CORS settings.
    */
    "cors": {
        /*
            The allowed CORS origin to validate requests against.
        */
        "origin": null
    },

    /*
      The Asset Library mode. `full` (default) will enable the full feature set and
      use Neptune as its datastore, whereas `lite` will offer a reduced feature set 
      (see documentation) and use the AWS IoT Device Registry as its datastore.
    */
    "mode": "full",

    /*
      If true, fine-grained access control will be enabled. Refer to documentation 
      for additional steps required (custom IdP claims).
    */
    "authorization": {
        "enabled": false
    },

    /*
      Application logging level. Set to (in order) error, warn, info, verbose, debug 
      or silly.
    */
    "logging": {
        "level": "debug"
    }
}
```

## Required Configuration For Running Locally

As part of the deployment flow there is some configuration that is auto-discovered and set. If running the Asset Library locally, the following configuration will need defining manually via the Asset Library's `{env}-config.json` file.

```json
{
    /*
      AWS Neptune URL of the Asset Library database (if running in full mode)
    */
    "neptuneUrl": "?",
    
    "aws": {
        /*
          The AWS region code 
        */        
        "region": "?",

        /* 
          The AWS IoT endpoint
        */
        "iot": {
            "endpoint": "?"
        }
    }
}

```
