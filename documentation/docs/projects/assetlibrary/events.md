# ASSET LIBRARY EVENTS

The asset library publishes messages to configurable MQTT topics on certain events taking place.

## Configuration

By default, the MQTT event topics are confgured as follows, but may be overridden per deployment:

```yaml
events:
  groups:
    topic: cdf/assetlibrary/events/groups/{objectId}/{event}
  devices:
    topic: cdf/assetlibrary/events/devices/{objectId}/{event}
  policies:
    topic: cdf/assetlibrary/events/policies/{objectId}/{event}
  groupTemplates:
    topic: cdf/assetlibrary/events/groupTemplates/{objectId}/{event}
  deviceTemplates:
    topic: cdf/assetlibrary/events/deviceTemplates/{objectId}/{event}
```

`{objectId}` represents the unique identifier as follows:

- groups:  `groupPath`
- devices: `deviceId`
- policies: `policyId`
- groupTemplates: `templateId`
- deviceTemplates: `templateId`

## Events

The payload for the MQTT message is as follows:

```json
{
    "objectId": "<groupPath | deviceId | policyId | templateId>",
    "type": "<groups | groupTemplates | devices | deviceTemplates | policies>",
    "event": "<create | modify | delete>",
    "payload": "<refer to specific event below>",
    "attributes": {
        <refer to specific event below>
    }
}
```
