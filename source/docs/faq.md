### Q. How is this different from what I can do today?

AWS Connected Device Framework takes an opinionated approach to implementing the above listed features. This helps you get up and running quickly. If these features are not an exact match for what you want, you can always customize the framework through well-defined interfaces. In the current version, you may customize Authentication and Authorization provider, device onboarding workflow, device metadata, asset data, and OTA. If customization also does not meet your needs, you can extend the base framework at well-defined extension points to implement functionality to suit your need.

### Q. Can I modify the framework and use it in my applications?

Yes, you may modify the framework. We encourage customers to contribute enhancements to the framework.
