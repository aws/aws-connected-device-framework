     * A table that specifies a "preferred version" for a given NPM package.  This feature is typically used
     * to hold back an indirect dependency to a specific older version, or to reduce duplication of indirect dependencies.
     *
     * The "preferredVersions" value can be any SemVer range specifier (e.g. "~1.2.3").  Rush injects these values into
     * the "dependencies" field of the top-level common/temp/package.json, which influences how the package manager
     * will calculate versions.  The specific effect depends on your package manager.  Generally it will have no
     * effect on an incompatible or already constrained SemVer range.  If you are using PNPM, similar effects can be
     * achieved using the pnpmfile.js hook.  See the Rush documentation for more details.
     *
     * After modifying this field, it's recommended to run "rush update --full" so that the package manager
     * will recalculate all version selections.

     * trouble for indirect dependencies with incompatible peerDependencies ranges.

     * accepted by "rush check" for a given dependency.
