# COMMANDS TARGETS

## Introduction

Devices within the CDF platform are identified by a `deviceId` and grouped in hierarchies.  This structure is managed by the *CDF Asset Library* module.

When creating commands to be executed by a device, a list of targets is required.  These targets may comprise of CDF devices, CDF groups, AWS IoT thing ARN's, and/or AWS IoT group ARN's.

## AWS IoT Service Limitations

AWS IoT has the following service limitations which are of importance here:

Service | Action | Limit
---|---|---
Jobs | Max. no. targets | 100
Things | Max. groups membership | 10
Things | Group membership | A Thing cannot belong to multiple grups that share a common ancestor

## Command / Job Targets

When a command is published, an *AWS IoT Job* is created to broadcast the command to the device for execution.  The Thing ARN's are identified based on the target type provided as follows:

Target Type | Action
---|---
CDF Asset Library group | The Thing ARN's of all active devices associated with the group are retrieved
CDF Asset Library device | The Thing ARN is retrieved for the device
Thing ARN | The Thing ARN is used directly
Thing Group ARN | The Thing Group ARN is used directly

If the total number of target Thing ARN's identified above exceeds the maximum allowed for a job, an ephemeral group is created to encompass the ARN's as the job target.  Thing Group ARN's are intentionally not expanded in this way - if the number of provided Thing Group ARN's exceeds the maximum allowed targets for a Job, a validation error is thrown.

## Job LifeCycle Events

When jobs are completed or cancelled, messages are sent to the following MQTT reserved topics:

```sh
$aws/events/job/jobID/completed
$aws/events/job/jobID/canceled
```

Upon cancellation/completion, if an ephemeral group was created for the Job, it is automatically deleted by the *CDF Commands* module.
