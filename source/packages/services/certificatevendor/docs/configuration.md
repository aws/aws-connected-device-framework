# CERTIFICATE VENDOR CONFIGURATION

The recommended way to create a local configuration file for the Certificate Vendor service is through CDF's [installer](../../installer/README.md#deployment-using-wizard).
# Configuration for Running Locally

Once you had deployed cdf to your AWS account, you can generate `.env` file to be used for your local development

The instruction to generate the local file can be found [here](../../installer/README.md#local-development). The `.env` file will be populated with resources and options that are specified during the deployment wizard flow.

```ini
# The AWS IoT continuous job uses a static thing group as its target. The thing group `cdfRotateCertificates`
# is created automatically by the deployment. Change the name of the thing group if you want to use an
# alternate thing group.

# The key prefix, and key suffix, where certificates are stored

#$ The MQTT topics to publish/subscribe. If alternate topics are required, change here. Note that
# the alternate MQTT topics will need providing as part of the deployment as the CloudFormation
# template sets up the consuming AWS IoT Rules.

# When a certficate has been vended and activated, if the following values are set then the device registry
