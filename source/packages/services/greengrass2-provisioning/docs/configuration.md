# GREENGRASS V2 PROVISIONING CONFIGURATION

The recommended way to create a local configuration file for the Greengrass V2 Provisioning is through CDF's [installer](../../installer/README.md#deployment-using-wizard).
# Configuration for Running Locally

Once you had deployed cdf to your AWS account, you can generate `.env` file to be used for your local development

The instruction to generate the local file can be found [here](../../installer/README.md#local-development). The `.env` file will be populated with resources and options that are specified during the deployment wizard flow.
