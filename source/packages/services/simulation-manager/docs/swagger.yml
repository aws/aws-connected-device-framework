  title: "AWS Connected Device Framework: Simulation Manager"
  description: >
    The Simulation Manager service allows you to manage
    and simulate a fleet of devices using different test plans. 
  version: 2.0.0


tags:
- name: Simulation
  description: |
    An `Simulation` manages how we run and orchistrate different test plans
    A Simulation can be composed of multiple Modules and task that will be run in tandem to simulate a device or a fleet of devices 
- name: Module
  description: |
    An `Module` represents a self contained piece of code that can be run by the simulation to generate data, simulate a device behavior, etc 
- name: Task
  description: |
    A `Task` represents the executional section of the simulation.
    Based on the configaration of the task multiple ECS instances can be spun up to run the simulation in parallel
    During the execution of a task an instance is spun up from the simulation ECS image. This instance will use jmeter to execute the provided test plan
