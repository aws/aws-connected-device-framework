# Greengrass Installer Config Overview

## Introduction

The Greengrass Installer Config module is responsible generating Greengrass config.yaml for [manual provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/quick-installation.html) or [fleet provisioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/fleet-provisioning.html). The lambda functions on this module will be invoked by the Greengrass V2 Provisioning module as part of the Creating Greengrass Core tasks operation.

Refer to the [Greengrass V2 Provisioning Module](../greengrass2-provisioning/README.md) for more detailed information on the over all Greengrass Version 2 Feature.
