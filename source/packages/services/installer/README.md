# Getting Started

The `installer` module provides a set of tools for installing and managing CDF modules.

## Prerequisite

### CDF Module Bundles

Ensure that CDF modules had been built and bundled ready for deployment.

```shell
aws-connected-device-framework/source> rush bundle
```

### IAM Credentials

The installer executes a number of aws commands (e.g, `aws cloudformation package`, `aws cloudformation deploy`) to upload artifacts and deploy the modules to the target account. Ensure that you have IAM credential with the right policies set up on your shell when running the scripts below.

## Build

To build the installer module run this script

```shell
aws-connected-device-framework/source> cd packages/services/installer
aws-connected-device-framework/source/packages/services/installer> rushx create:installer
```

## Commands

### Deploying using the wizard

Start the deployment wizard using the following command:

```shell
> cdf-cli deploy <environment> <region>
```

| Argument      | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `environment` | the environment to deploy |
| `region`      | the region to deploy into |

The deployment wizard will ask a series of questions to determine which CDF modules need to be deployed based on the selected options. Once you finish the deployment, a configuration file for your deployment state will be stored in `~/aws-connected-device-framework/config/<ACCOUNT_ID>/<REGION>/<ENVIRONMENT>`, `ENVIRONMENT` will be the file name. It is recommended to add these generated configuration files to source control so that others can update the deployment.

### Deploying using an existing configuration

The installer wizard can be bypassed by providing a pre-existing installer configuration file, the same file generated from the using the installer wizard, as follows:

| Argument            | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `environment`       | the environment to deploy                                                |
| `region`            | the region to deploy into                                                |
| `deployment-config` | location of deployment configuration file generated by deployment wizard |

```shell
> cdf-cli deploy <environment> <region> -c <deployment-config>
```

This will deploy all the modules configured in your last deployment wizard run. This type of deployment is recommended for continuous integration and automated deployments.


### Packaging

The packaging command will package all the modules that selected and upload both the CloudFormation template files and parameter files to S3 bucket.

For example, if you specify `cdf-packaging-bucket` as the s3 bucket to use, the templates will be uploaded to `s3://cdf-packaging-bucket/cloudformation/templates` and the parameters file will be uploaded to `s3://cdf-packaging-bucket/cloudformation/parameters`.

The installer will try to pre-populate the parameters file based on your answer and default value in the CloudFormation template, but there are some parameters that are dependent on the output of other stacks, make sure you deploy the stack in the right sequence.


#### Packaging using the wizard

This command will guide you through wizard and package the templates and pre-populate the parameters file based on your answer.

```shell
> cdf-cli package <environment> <region>
```

| Argument      | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `environment` | the environment to deploy |
| `region`      | the region to deploy into |

The wizard will ask a series of questions to determine which CDF modules need to be packaged based on the selected options. Once you finish the deployment, a configuration file for your module selection will be stored in `~/aws-connected-device-framework/config/<ACCOUNT_ID>/<REGION>/<ENVIRONMENT>`, `ENVIRONMENT` will be the file name. 

#### Packaging using an existing configuration

The wizard can be bypassed by providing a pre-existing installer configuration file, the same file generated from the above step, as follows:

| Argument            | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `environment`       | the environment to deploy                                                |
| `region`            | the region to deploy into                                                |
| `deployment-config` | location of deployment configuration file generated by deployment wizard |

```shell
> cdf-cli package <environment> <region> -c <deployment-config>
```


#### Deploying the packaged template manually

Below are the details of each module ordered by deployment sequence (for full CDF deployment). If you only want to deploy some modules, locate the module on the table and workbackward from the list of dependencies to figure out which module that needs to be deployed as pre-requisite.

> **_NOTE:_**  The file name in template column refers to the packaged template that is uploaded to S3 as part of the packacing process, but the link will redirect you to the pre-packaged file.

### Deleting stacks

This will remove all the stacks that have been created based on a deployment:

| Argument      | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `environment` | the environment to deploy |
| `region`      | the region to deploy into |

```shell
> cdf-cli delete <environment> <region>
```

### Generating Postman environment file

This retrieves the urls for all the CDF modules that expose a REST API endpoint and prints out an [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments) json file that can be imported into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/rest-client/).

| Argument      | Description                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `name`        | name of Postman environment |
| `environment` | the environment to deploy   |
| `region`      | the region to deploy into   |

```shell
> cdf-cli postman <name> <environment> <region>
```

### Local development

You can generate the `env` file automatically for all the modules by running the following command:

| Argument            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `environment`       | the environment to deploy                                    |
| `region`            | the region to deploy into                                    |
| `deployment-config` | deployment configuration file generated by deployment wizard |
| `output-folder`     | the folder to store the generated env file(s)                |

```shell
> cdf-cli config-to-env <environment> <region> <deployment-config> <output-folder>
```

The `.env` file for each of the deployed modules will be generated in the `output-folder`.

If you want to run the module locally, you need to specify the `CONFIG_LOCATION` environment variable when starting the module. As an example, if you want to run the provisioning module locally:

```shell
aws-connected-device-framework/source/packages/services/provisioning> export CONFIG_LOCATION=<path-to-provisioning-env-file>; npm run start
```
