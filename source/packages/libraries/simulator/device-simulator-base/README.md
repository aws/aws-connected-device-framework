# CDF DEVICE SIMULATOR BASE OVERVIEW

## Introduction

This library contains the reusable components of a device simulator such as the management of the state machine, AWS IoT connectivity, message construction, and a calculations engine.

To create a device simulator from these reusable components the high level steps are:

- state machine design
- telemetry message design
- shadow implementation
- calculations design and implementation
- state machine implementation
- telemetry message implementation
- wiring everything up
- launching
