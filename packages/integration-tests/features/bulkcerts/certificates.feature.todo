  # Note: Testing of Get call is done in the create and delete steps

  Scenario: Request a New Batch of Certificates
    Given batch "integration-test-batch" does not exist
    When I request batch certificates with batch id "integration-test-batch" and batchInfo
      """
      {
        "certInfo":{
          "commonName": "test.org",
          "organization": "integration",

        "quantity":5,
        "register": false,
        "batchId": "integration-test-batch"
      }
      """
